As a developer who loves building products quickly, I've discovered that launching a website in 24 hours isn't just possible – it's becoming the new normal. In this guide, I'll walk you through three powerful tech stacks and show you how AI tools are revolutionizing rapid development.

## Why Build Fast?

The ability to quickly validate ideas has become crucial in today's fast-paced tech landscape. Building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in 24 hours allows you to:
- Test market validation without heavy investment
- Get immediate user feedback
- Iterate rapidly based on real user behavior
- Maintain momentum and enthusiasm for your project

## Essential AI Tools for Rapid Development

Before diving into tech stacks, let's talk about two game-changing AI tools that will supercharge your development speed:

### Cursor IDE
Cursor IDE has transformed my coding workflow with:
- AI-powered code completion that understands context
- Natural language to code conversion

Hours 19-22: Optimization
- Image optimization
- Performance tuning
- SEO implementation
- Error boundaries

Hours 23-24: Deployment

## Best Practices for 24-Hour Development

1. Start with a Clear MVP Scope
- List essential features only
- Avoid feature creep
- Focus on core functionality

2. Use Component Libraries
- Material UI
- Chakra UI
- Tailwind CSS

3. Leverage AI Tools
- Use Cursor IDE for faster coding
- Implement AI-generated components
- Utilize AI for code review

4. Don't Neglect These Essentials

- Loading states

## Post-Launch Considerations

Even in a 24-hour build, consider setting up:
- Analytics tracking
- Error monitoring
- User feedback channels
- Backup systems
```
